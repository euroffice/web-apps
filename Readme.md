## Styling

Styling is accomplished via LESS, there is the content set by ONLYOFFICE. Before you do anything, please read the section under this about modifications.

There are several hundred LESS files, organised in several folders:

#### Common (shared)

```shell
apps/common/embed/resources/less/
apps/common/forms/resources/less/
apps/common/main/resources/less/
apps/common/main/resources/mods/less/
apps/common/mobile/resources/less/
```

Common is the most important and many of the others just import common.

They use variables:

`apps/common/main/resources/less/variables.less` <- majority seem to be shared from there.

The variables seem to be a bit haphazard in approach. There is some structure, but not uniformly adhered to. The variables are used in other files, so the lack of structure is not so much an issue.

Importing is via relative paths.

#### Document Editor

```shell
apps/documenteditor/embed/resources/less/
apps/documenteditor/forms/resources/less/
apps/documenteditor/main/resources/less/
apps/documenteditor/mobile/src/less/
```

#### Spreadsheet Editor

```shell
apps/spreadsheeteditor/main/resources/less/
apps/spreadsheeteditor/mobile/src/less/
```

#### Presentation Editor

```shell
apps/presentationeditor/embed/resources/less/
apps/presentationeditor/main/resources/less/
apps/presentationeditor/mobile/src/less/
```

#### PDF Editor

```shell
apps/pdfeditor/main/resources/less/
```


#### Visio Editor

```shell
apps/visioeditor/main/resources/less/
```


Each directory has a range of LESS files broken down by area, eg slider, search, buttons etc - too many to list here, but should be helpful in finding the correct place to make style changes

## Style modifications

We want to make upstream updates as painless as possible. From the perspective of making modifications we have added theming capability to the office package.

### Building using a theme

You need to use a env variable.

#### Set ENV var

```shell
THEME=[your theme] grunt [optional grunt command]
```
eg
```shell
THEME=nextcloud grunt less-all
```
> If you do this, you need to restart the docker eo, as the css files are cache busted
> `docker compose exec eo bash`

> If you add images, these need to be copied, to do that, you need to run `grunt` with no params (or on AMR64, with --skip-imagemin)

#### Setting up a theme

Look at `apps/common/main/resources/less/themes/nextcloud` as an example.

The idea is to use variables set in the `theme` file as much as possible, and use the overrides feature if it is not possible to just use a variable. By using variables, we don't introduce extra CSS in the final output.

The `overrides` directory should match the structure of the existing app. It is only when it is not possible to accomplish the styling using variables.
